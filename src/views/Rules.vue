                <h1>RULES OF PLAY & POLICIES</h1>

                <h2>SPORTSMANSHIP</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> We share the common interest to inspire our children
                        to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
                        coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
                        detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
                        technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>DIMENSIONS:</b> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                        within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
                        dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
                        and older.</li>
                    <li><b>COMPETITION FIELDS:</b> Fields used within the competition program must
                        be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
                        participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
                        field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                        Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
                        field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                        dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                        associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
                        required to play all their games away.</li>

                    <li><b>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</b>.
                        <ol>
                            <li> U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
                                areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.</li>
                            <li>
                                U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
                            <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>
                            <li>In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
                                dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
